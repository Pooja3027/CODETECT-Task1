## Overview of the Project:

### Project : NLP Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes and Tkinter GUI

This project is a sentiment analysis tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The project is built using Python and leverages the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification. Additionally, it features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter to display the results of the sentiment analysis in an interactive way.

### Features:

 - **Dataset:** Utilizes the IMDB movie reviews dataset.
 - **NLP Model:** Implements a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis.
 - **Text Preprocessing:** Uses the CountVectorizer from sklearn to convert text data into a matrix of token counts.
 - **Training and Evaluation:** Splits the dataset into training and test sets to train the model and evaluate its performance.
 - **GUI:** A user-friendly interface built with Tkinter to display the results, including accuracy and classification report.

### Project Structure:
- **IMDB Dataset.csv:** The dataset containing movie reviews and their corresponding sentiments.
- **main.py:** The main script that runs the sentiment analysis and launches the GUI.

### How It Works:

- **Data Loading:** The script reads the IMDB dataset containing movie reviews labeled as either "positive" or "negative."
- **Data Splitting:** The dataset is split into training and test sets (80% training, 20% testing).
- **Model Training:** A Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the training data.
- **Model Evaluation:** The model is evaluated on the test set, and metrics such as accuracy and a detailed classification report are generated.
- **GUI Display:** The results, including the number of positive and negative reviews, overall accuracy, and the classification report, are displayed in a new window via the Tkinter GUI.
